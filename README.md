Task 2: Timeline Extension

Subject: Request for Extension on Task Due Date

Dear Internal Success Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to meet the original due date for the task, which was due tomorrow.

Unfortunately, I have a family emergency that requires my immediate attention and I won't be able to complete the task as planned. I understand that this may cause inconvenience and I deeply apologize for the situation.

I would like to request an extension of three days from the original due date. I am confident that I will be able to complete the task within this timeframe and I will do my best to make up for the delay.

Please let me know if this extension is possible, and if there is any additional information or support I can provide.

Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

[Sangam Kumar Singh]
